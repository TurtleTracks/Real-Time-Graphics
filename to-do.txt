Real-Time Graphics To-Do: 

create scene-object interface with base functions: 
    initialize
    update
    destroy

create scene structure for quick traversal of scene objects:
    possibly a list or heap

force gpu rendering 

Replace "radiosity" shader with a shader that actually works 

Determine system for inserting/adding/swapping(?) shaders 

Launcher window dimensions and camera/shader rendering dimensions should be matched 

interesting note: 
Shaders are associated with vertex/triangle buffers, 
but render to a screen sized texture. 
How would I swap shaders? 

the texture is part of the framebuffer and is independent of the currently set shader
